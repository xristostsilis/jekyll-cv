# Profile
profile: |
  I'm an Electrican and computer engineering graduate from university of Patras, currently working on IT. 
      I have a very big interest on new technology, i like to create robust ideas that lead to good product designs.
      My intergraded-master thesis was about 5G in Greek public roads in which i created a Python-based tool that calculates 
      the maximum radius of any 5G antenna. I also like to create my own hardware and software because in my exprerience the outcome
      is always awesome. I did this exact thing on my thesis, in which i creted my own 5G router with a propritery fw that can run 24/7
      with no hiccups under high loads because it used hardware and software acceleration algorithms.
